(** 
   Representation of the Gomoku game.

   This module represents the board, players, moves that occur during the
   game, winners, and functions that result in player moves.
*)

(** The type of game boards. *)
type board = string array array

(** The type of player. *)
type player = {
  id: string;
  games_won: int;
  is_turn: bool;
  color: string;
  last_move: int list;
}

(** [print_board board] is the visual representation of the Gomoku board, using
    the ‘+’ character for empty spots. Player 1’s stones are represented by the
     char 'O', colored according to Player 1's color, and Player 2’s stones 
     are represented by the char 'O', colored according to Player 2's color.
    The board [board] is the current board with all the players' moves. *)
val print_color : board -> unit

(** [make_move board x y] updates the game board with the player’s move. The
    board [board] represents the game board the players are adding a move to.
    The int [x] is the x coordinate of the board and the int [y] is the y
    coordinate of the board. The players must take turns to make moves to
    maintain the order between Player 1 and Player 2’s stones. *)
val make_move : board -> int -> int -> player -> unit

(** [check_victor board] is the bool if the game has a winner. The board [board]
    is the current board with all the players' moves. *)
val  check_victor: board -> int -> int -> bool

(** [check_tie board] is the bool if the game has resulted in a tie. The board 
    [board] is the current board with all the players' moves. A tie only occurs 
    if the board is filled, meaning there are no more moves to be made and there
    is no winner.*)
val  check_tie: board -> bool

(** [get_turn player] is the bool representing if the turn belongs to the 
    player. The player [player] represents a player in the game.  *)
val get_turn: player -> bool

(** [get_turn player] is the int representing player's id number. The player 
    [player] represents a player in the game.  *)
val get_id: player -> string

(** [get_games_won player] is the int representing the number of games
    this player has won. The player [player] represents a player in the game. *)
val get_games_won: player -> int

(** [update_score player] is the updated player [player] that shows how many 
    games the player has won thus far. The player [player] represents the 
    player who won the previous game that gets a point added to their score.  *)
val update_games_won: player -> player

(** [update_score board] is of type score and keeps track of how many games
    each player has won in a session. The score [score] represents the current
     points earned by each player.  *)
val update_score: player -> player

(** [change_turn player] is the updated player [player] that shows how many 
    games the player has won thus far. The player [player] represents the 
    player who won the previous game that gets a point added to their score. *)
val change_turn: player -> player

(** [clear_board board] updates the board [board] to an empty board of the
    same dimensions as [board]. Empty spots are represented by the string " + ".
    The board [board] is the board with the players' moves. *)
val clear_board: board -> unit

(** [find_color color] is the string presentation of the color of a
    player's stones to be printed on the board. The string [color] is the 
    string representation for the color of a player's stones. *)
val find_color: string -> string

(** [create_board dimensions] create the string array array representing
    the game board. The int [dimensions] is the length of the game board. *)
val create_board: int -> board

(** [available_colors color1] returns the list of string representations of 
    colors and each color's respective ANSITerminal style, except for the color 
    represented by [color1]. The string [color1] represents the color that 
    player 1 chose; therefore, player 2 cannot be allowed to choose the 
    same color.*)
val available_colors: 'a -> ('a * 'b) list -> 'c -> ('a * 'b) list

(** [load_game name] is the board saved on the CSV file. The string [name] 
    represents the CSV file name. The string [name] must be a valid CSV file
    name that ends in ".csv".*)
val load_game: string -> board

(** [load_players lst] represents players in a specific format. The string 
    list [lst] represents the data collected from a CSV file about the players.
    The format contains a player representing the first player loaded, a bool
    representing if that player is a bot, a player representing the second
    player loaded, a bool representing if that player is a bot, a bool 
    representing which player has the first turn (true means the first player, 
    false means the second player), and a string representing any 
    bot players. *)
val load_players: string -> player * bool * player * bool * bool * string

(** [load_bot_players lst] represents players in a specific format. The string 
    list [lst] represents the data collected from a CSV file about the players.
    The format contains a player representing the first player loaded, a bool
    representing if that player is a bot, a player representing the second
    player loaded, a bool representing if that player is a bot, a bool 
    representing which player has the first turn (true means the first player, 
    false means the second player), and a string representing any 
    bot players. *)
val load_bot_players: string list list -> player * bool * 
                                          player * bool * bool * string

(** [save_human_players player1 player2 name first] updates a CSV file with 
    the two specified players. The player [player1] represents first player and
    the player [player2] represents the second player in the game. 
    The string [name] represents the name of the CSV file to save the 
    human player information to. If the file name exists, the file is update, 
    otherwise a new file of that name is created. The player [first] represents
    which player has their turn first. 

    The string [name] must end with ".csv" in order to create a valid file.*)
val save_human_players: player -> player -> string -> player -> unit

(** [save_board board name] updates a CSV file with the specified board. 
    The board [board] represents the current game board with the players' moves.
    The string [name] represents the name of the CSV file to save the 
    board information to. If the file name exists, the file is update, 
    otherwise a new file of that name is created. 

    The string [name] must end with ".csv" in order to create a valid file.*)
