(** Type board represents the Gomoku board. The board is represented by a 
    string array array, which must be either length 13 or 15. 

    The players must input a valid length in order to start the game.
    The players will be asked to re-input the value if it is not valid.  *)

(** Type player represents a player in the Gomoku game. The player is 
    represented by a record that stores information that the player inputs or is
    generated as the game progresses. The string [id] is the player-inputted 
    name for their player. The int [games_won] represents how many games this 
    player has won, including saved games. The bool [is_turn] represents if it
    is currently this players turn. The string [color] represents the color of 
    this player's stone. The int list [last_move] represents the x and y
    coordinates of the player's previous move.

    A player must input a valid ID and color choice when playing the game in 
    order to start the game. The players will be asked to re-input the value 
    if it is not valid.*)
